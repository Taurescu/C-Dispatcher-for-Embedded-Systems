# C-Dispatcher-for-Embedded-Systems

This is my full implementation for the embedded system task dispatcher of Ron Kreymborgi. It's a small but yet powerful task dispatcher aimed specifically at resource starved systems. It is suitable for many small embedded systems which have restrictions on program memory size.

The dispatcher is described in the following document. I have also integrated it into a PIC32 project and provided a test application for my implementation. It's provided in Microchip MPLAB-X. To run it, install the Microchip MPLAB-X development environment as well as XC32 compiler (make sure that you install PLIB).
